# Machine_Learning_Exercises
This is a repo of some Deep/Machine Learning practice I do from time to time.

-Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis -  a simple script that let's a user input a word or phrase, the script then searches for tweets
containing the word and uses textblob to analyze the sentiments of the tweeter.

-deep_dream - An implementation of google's deep dream using the inception library and TensorFlow. I'm still tweaking the values with this one, I realy want to make a cool image using it.
